   <p> VO offers the core Veda-TIMES functionality via Internet browsers. <a href="https://veda-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/introduction.html#architecture" target="_blank">Veda model folders</a> need to reside on GitHub to be used under VO. Registered users can submit their GitHub credentials to see a list of all model folders, along with the branches, under their account. Any folder/branch can be selected
   to create a model. Supported functionality: Synchronize (all files only, at this point), Browse, Items view, Run manager, Results, and Reports. </p>
